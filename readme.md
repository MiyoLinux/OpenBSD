These are just my personal dot files, scripts, etc. that I use on OpenBSD. 
I'm not a git-guru, so if things look a little strange...well...hahaha!

The "Screencast" file shows the terminal commands that I use to record the screen, audio, and my webcam (I have a script that operates the webcam in /usr/local/bin/webcam) when making videos. Video and audio have to be aligned in the editor (Shotcut).

If anyone wants to use anything here, feel free to. :)
