I have four menus that I sometimes switch between. Three of them are using pmenu to provide the dynamic applications menu, the fourth one is completely manual.

Each menu has a "Menu Chooser" and "Menu Backup". They are controlled through some basic scripts that I included in the /usr/local/bin/ folder.
