I have four menus that I sometimes switch between. Three of them are using pmenu to provide the dynamic applications menu, the fourth one is completely manual. Two of the menus have icons. One menu uses the Paper icon theme, and the other menu uses the Papirus icon theme. Each menu is named accordingly and are found in the "menus" folder.

Each menu has a "Menu Chooser" and "Menu Backup". They are controlled through some basic scripts that I included in the /usr/local/bin/ folder.
