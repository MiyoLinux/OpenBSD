I have four menus that I sometimes switch between. Three of them are using pmenu to provide a pipe menu to supply a dynamic applications menu.

The fourth menu is completely manual. 

Two of the menus have icons. One uses the Paper icon theme, and the other menu uses the Papirus icon theme. The Paper icon theme is available in the OpenBSD repositories. The Papirus icons have to be downloaded and installed.

Each menu is named accordingly and are found in the "menus" folder.

Each menu has a "Menu Chooser" and "Menu Backup". They are controlled through some basic scripts that I included in the /usr/local/bin/ folder.
