This is my personal theme for the MOC music player. Feel free to use it if you want. 

I'm using the Sakura terminal, and the colors work on all of the supplied theme palettes, but in my opinion, it looks the best on either the Tango theme or the Gruvbox theme. My terminal's background color is #1f2326

Tango theme...
